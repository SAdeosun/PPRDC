This classifier (Pharmacy Practice Research Domain Classifier; PPRDC) was derived from finetuning a lightweight Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model (Bioformer-16L), using labeled data. The labeled data is a set of 1000 abstracts of articles randomly selected from articles published by pharmacy practice faculty between 2018-2021. The classifier classifies the supplied article into research domains including "Clinical", "Education", "Social & Administrative", and "Basic Science & Translational". For each supplied abstract, the classifier also returns the probability of belonging to each of the four research domains.
The model outperformed zero-shot performances of mainstream large language models including GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3.5, LLAMA-3.1, and Mistral Large. Unlike the LLMs, the predicted class and the probabilities were 100% reproducible with PPRDC.
The model is available on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/SAdeosun/Pharmacy-Practice-Research-Domain-Classifier_PPRDC_Abstract) and also through a no-code web application on Streamlit (https://sadeosun-pprdc.streamlit.app/)
